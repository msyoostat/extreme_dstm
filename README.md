# Intro
This is the Github repo for the paper "Modeling high and low extremes with a novel dynamic spatio-temporal model" by Myungsoo Yoo, Likun Zhang, Christopher K. Wikle, and Thomas Opitz. The preprint is available on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01481.

In this work, we propose a physically motivated spatio-temporal dynamic model in which the innovations switch between heavy- and light-tailed distributions according to a probability, capturing external drivers of extreme events. The framework accounts for spatial and temporal dependence without assuming temporal independence and allows flexible extremal dependence across space and time. It also provides a fully model-based approach for detecting extreme events with uncertainty quantification. We illustrate the model using hourly PM2.5 data over the Central U.S. in March 2024.

# real_data
## data
- pm2_5_hour_5.RData: This dataset contains PM2.5 measurements used in the paper, focusing on Arkansas, Oklahoma, and southwestern Missouri from March 19 at 00:30 to March 30 at 23:30. The original data are from NASAâ€™s GEOS-CF v1.0 system (Keller et al., 2021).
- hourly3_basis_170_4_2_crs.RData: This dataset contains the local basis functions used for PM2.5 dataset. 
## code
- pm_2_5_full_stable.R: This is the code to fit the "stable" model described in Section 7.1.
- pm_2_5_full_vg.R: This is the code to fit the "variance-gamma" model described in Section 7.1.
- pm_2_5_missing_stable.R: This is the code to fit the "stable" model described in Section 7.2.
